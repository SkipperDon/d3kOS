=== COMPLETE FIX FOR ATMYBOAT.COM ===

PROBLEM: WordPress Astra theme is interfering with custom HTML homepage
SOLUTION: Fix all issues at once

=== FIX 1: Hero Title Spacing ===

WordPress is removing spaces. Fix with proper spacing:

Go to: Pages → Home → Edit → Code editor

Find line 3:
<h1>SMART MARINE MONITORING FOR MODERN BOATERS</h1>

Replace with (using letter-spacing CSS):
<h1 style="letter-spacing: 0.05em;">SMART MARINE MONITORING FOR MODERN BOATERS</h1>

=== FIX 2: Wrong Menu ===

The Astra theme header is overriding your menu.

Go to: Appearance → Customize → Header Builder → Primary Header → Primary Menu

OR

Go to: Astra Settings → disable theme header, use custom menu

OR SIMPLEST:

Go to: Appearance → Menus → Manage Locations
Set "Primary Menu" to your menu (with Home, Blog, Shop, etc.)

=== FIX 3: Remove "HOME" Text ===

This is the Astra theme site title.

Go to: Appearance → Customize → Site Identity
- Uncheck "Display Site Title"
- Keep only logo

=== FIX 4: Make Sure Full Content Shows ===

The tiers section should be visible.

Check: Settings → Reading → Homepage displays: "A static page" → Home

If still not showing, the page template might be wrong:
Pages → Home → Edit → Look for "Template" in right sidebar → Set to "Default Template"

=== ALL FIXES SUMMARY ===

1. Fix hero title spacing (add style="letter-spacing: 0.05em;")
2. Fix menu (Manage Locations → set Primary Menu)
3. Remove "HOME" text (Site Identity → uncheck Display Site Title)
4. Verify homepage template is "Default Template"
