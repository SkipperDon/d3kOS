## SECTION 5: About At My Boat

### About At My Boat

At My Boat started as a personal blog about family boating adventures and DIY electronics projects. It's grown into a community-driven platform where boaters share knowledge, troubleshoot problems, and push the boundaries of what's possible with open-source marine technology.

The d3kOS project emerged from years of frustration with expensive, proprietary marine electronics that didn't talk to each other. We believe boaters should have access to professional-grade systems without the professional-grade price tags—and without being locked into closed ecosystems.

**Our mission is simple:** Make smart boating accessible, approachable, and affordable for everyone. Whether you're a weekend warrior or a liveaboard cruiser, you deserve technology that works *for* you, not *against* you.
