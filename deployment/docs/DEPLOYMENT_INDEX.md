# d3kOS Deployment Document Index

**Project:** d3kOS / Helm-OS
**Maintained:** Update this file every time a solution document is created or a feature is deployed.

This is the master index of all solution documents, feature deployments, and architectural records for d3kOS. If something was built, fixed, or deployed, it must have an entry here.

## Governing Standards (Don's Engineering Standards)

These documents define how all AI work must be performed. They are embedded in full in `/home/boatiq/CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded every session). Source files in `/home/boatiq/`:

| Source File | Document Name |
|-------------|--------------|
| `1 Master AI Engineering & Testing Standard.md` | Master AI Engineering, Coding, and Testing Standard |
| `1 standar test case creation template.md` | Standard Test Case Creation Template |
| `1 AI Egnieering & Automated Testing Specification Template.md` | AI Engineering & Automated Testing Specification Template |
| `1 AI Egineering SPecification & Soltuion Design Template.md` | AI Engineering Specification & Solution Design Template |
| `aao-methodology-repo/SPECIFICATION.md` | AAO Autonomous Action Operating Methodology v1.1 — 820 lines, 16 sections. d3kOS is the reference implementation. Operational requirements for Claude extracted into `/home/boatiq/CLAUDE.md` Document 5. |

Claude acknowledges all five at the start of every session. See `/home/boatiq/CLAUDE.md` for full content.

## Technical Reference Documents (Don's Reference Guides)

Documents Don has written as technical references. Each is deployed as a solution doc in this project:

| Source File | Deployed To | What It Covers |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `1 openCPN using flatback.md` | `deployment/docs/OPENCPN_FLATPAK_OCHARTS.md` | OpenCPN Flatpak on Debian Trixie + O-Charts plugin — why Flatpak is required, how to activate charts (direct login method + fingerprint method) |

## Solution Documents — What Was Built and How

These documents explain what problem was solved and exactly how the solution works. Read these before touching any related code.

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|---------------|
| `deployment/docs/TOUCH_SCROLL_FIX.md` | labwc mouseEmulation fix — why scrolling broke and how it was fixed (rc.xml change) |
| `deployment/docs/OPENCPN_PINCH_ZOOM.md` | twofing daemon — two-finger pinch zoom in OpenCPN Flatpak via XWayland |
| `deployment/docs/SIGNALK_UPGRADE.md` | Signal K v2.20.3 → v2.22.1 — AIS memory leak fix, heap limit, cx5106 removal |
| `deployment/docs/VOICE_AUDIO_FIX.md` | Voice audio device fix — wrong ALSA card (HDMI) → Roland S-330 USB |
| `deployment/docs/VOICE_QUERY_SPEED.md` | Voice query 7.6s → 0.9s — lazy PDF import + bulk Signal K fetch |
| `deployment/docs/MARINE_VISION_CAMERA_SYSTEM.md` | **[SUPERSEDED — 2026-03-11]** Original two-camera cameras.json system. Replaced by camera-overhaul. Read-only history. |
| `deployment/docs/MARINE_VISION_CAMERA_OVERHAUL.md` | **[ACTIVE]** Slot/Hardware camera architecture — dynamic 1–20 camera management, slots.json + hardware.json, frame buffer, discovery scan, Settings UI camera management tab, Marine Vision dynamic tile renderer, fish detector multi-slot tagging |
| `deployment/docs/VERIFY_AGENT.md` | Independent code reviewer on TrueNAS VM — how it works, endpoints |
| `deployment/docs/WORKFLOW.md` | Ollama executor workflow — how features are built via Ollama |
| `deployment/docs/EXPORT_BOOT_RACE_FIX.md` | `d3kos-export-boot.service` FAILED since 2026-03-04 — root cause: `set -e` + `curl` exit 7 before Flask bound port 8094. Fix: `nc -z` port-ready loop, removed `set -e`, guarded curl/jq. Resolved 2026-03-11. |
| `deployment/docs/FORWARD_WATCH_WORKER_THREAD.md` | `signalk-forward-watch` v0.2.0 — onnxruntime loaded into SK main heap at require() time (~470MB) even when disabled. Fix: moved inference into Node.js Worker thread (`detector-worker.js`). SK heap unaffected. Deployed + verified stable 2026-03-11. |
| Pi: `/home/d3kos/install-opencpn.sh` | OpenCPN Flatpak launcher — bug fix 2026-03-11: `pgrep -f` → `pgrep -x` to prevent SSH command strings triggering false "already running" branch. APT 5.10.2 removed same session; only Flatpak 5.12.4 remains. |

## Feature Deployments — Ollama Executor Features

Each directory in `deployment/features/` contains a `feature_spec.md`, `phases.json`, Ollama output, and deployed source.

## Historical Archive — doc/

The `doc/` directory contains ~200 markdown files written during earlier development sessions (pre-v0.9.2). These are session completion reports, feature plans, fix summaries, Ollama specs, and architectural explorations. They are not actively maintained but serve as the historical record.

**Key docs in doc/ worth knowing:**

| Document | What It Covers |
|----------|---------------|
| `doc/MASTER_SYSTEM_SPEC.md` | Earlier system architecture spec |
| `doc/MARINE_VISION.md` / `doc/MARINE_VISION_API.md` | Phase 1 camera system design |
| `doc/TASK_3_MULTI_CAMERA_COMPLETE.md` | Multi-camera implementation completion record |
| `doc/TASK_1_FORWARD_WATCH_COMPLETE.md` | Forward Watch training completion record |
| `doc/TASK_2_METRIC_IMPERIAL_COMPLETE.md` | Metric/Imperial feature completion |
| `doc/v0.9.2_MULTI_CAMERA_SYSTEM_OLLAMA_SPEC.md` | Original Ollama spec for camera system |
| `doc/v0.9.2_GEMINI_API_INTEGRATION_OLLAMA_SPEC.md` | Gemini integration Ollama spec |
| `doc/v0.9.2_METRIC_IMPERIAL_CONVERSION_OLLAMA_SPEC.md` | Metric/Imperial Ollama spec |
| `doc/PROBLEMS_AND_RESOLUTIONS.md` | Problems encountered and how they were resolved |
| `doc/VOICE_ASSISTANT_ROOT_CAUSE_REPORT.md` | Voice assistant root cause analysis |
| `doc/forward-watch/` | All Forward Watch / obstacle detection docs |

**Rule:** For anything built after 2026-03-06, the solution document goes in `deployment/docs/`, not `doc/`. `doc/` is read-only history.

## Update Protocol

Every time work is completed:
1. If it fixed something: create a solution doc in `deployment/docs/`
2. If it is a new feature built via Ollama executor: it already has a `features/` dir
3. Update this index with a new row
4. Update `SESSION_LOG.md`
5. Update `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md`
